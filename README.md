A few notes for the reviewer:

The reason why I didn't use existing UI lib(for example, 8base Boost UI kit), was to show more code from myself.

But for the same reason the most styles are missing :)

Also I decided to use Typescript and drop most of the existing code to prevent copy-paste driven development.
